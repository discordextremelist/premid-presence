# premid-presence
The official Discord Extreme List PreMiD presence!

## Development
This contains missing files... if you wish to work on this presence please clone & submit a PR at the official [PreMiD Presences Repository](https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences)

* [Information on Developing a PreMiD Presence](https://docs.premid.app/en/dev/presence)

## Using Presence
You can use the source to install the presence as a temporary presence instead of installing it from the PreMiD Presence Store (not sure why you'd want to do that but it's an option...?)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/discordextremelist/premid-presence.git del-premid`),
2. Open your browser and press on the PreMiD extension icon,
3. Hold Shift and you should see `Load Presence` appear,
4. Press on the Load Presence text and wait for the folder selector to appear,
5. Find the `del-premid` folder, go into it and load the dist folder.
